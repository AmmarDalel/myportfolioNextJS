Key features include client management, image upload and cropping, scheduling with calendar, iframe generation for integration, an analytics dashboard with key metrics (views, clicks), as well as a notification and billing system. The architecture is built on Next.js full-stack with tRPC, Prisma, and PostgreSQL, ensuring end-to-end type safety and optimized performance.\n\nThe codebase is well-structured following a scalable architecture with dedicated folders: features (business features), components (reusable UI components), validation (schemas and validation rules), services (business logic), hooks (custom React hooks), and utils (utility functions). This structure improves maintainability, readability, and code reusability.",
